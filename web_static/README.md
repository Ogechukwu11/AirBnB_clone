# Web Development Basics: A Guide for Beginners

## HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

HTML is the backbone of web development, serving as the standard markup language for creating and structuring web pages. It uses a set of elements or tags to define the various components on a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

## How to Create an HTML Page

Creating an HTML page involves using a simple text editor like Notepad or a dedicated code editor like Visual Studio Code. Start with the <html> tag, add a <head> section for meta-information, and a <body> section for the content. Save the file with a .html extension.


## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS is a styling language that enhances the presentation of HTML elements. It allows you to define colors, fonts, layout, and more.
